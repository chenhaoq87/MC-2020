## Purpose: 
This repository is for Milk-MC team to work on modeling projects. 

## Background: 
The first published version of FSL-MQIP fluid milk MC model was published here: [Buehler, A. J., Martin, N. H., Boor, K. J., & Wiedmann, M. (2018). Psychrotolerant spore-former growth characterization for the development of a dairy spoilage predictive model. Journal of Dairy Science.](https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-14501). Michael Phillips edited the original fluid milk MC model, incorporating dynamic temperatures that change according to user-defined stages; M. Phillips also created a respository (FSL-MQIP/MC-Spore) in FSL-MQIP's GitHub organization where he uploaded the model files. On 1/28/20, Sarah Murphy created a new repository (FSL-MQIP/MC-2020) where she uploaded a copy of files stored in FSL-MQIP/MC-Spore.
