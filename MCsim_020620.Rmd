##Set important parameters for running the simulation:

# (1) n_sim
# Definition: Number of simulations to run (also referred to as the number of bulk tanks in earlier code; i.e., 1 simulation unit = 1 bulk tank of milk)
n_sim <-100    #1000 is for testing and exploring, experiments require at least 10k

#(2) n_units 
# Definition: Number of units per lot (currently, half gallon units) 
n_units <-10

# (3) start_day 
# Definition: First time point (in days) in unit's shelf life to simulate
start_day <- 1 

# (4) end_day 
# Definition: Last time point (in days) in unit's shelf life to simulate
end_day <- 24 
n_day <- 24 # seems like this is the end_day, but keeping code below for now in case my interpretation is wrong

## Prep vectors based on defined values above
bulk_tank <- rep(seq(1, n_sim), each = n_units * n_day) #Repeat each element of the sequence 1..n_sim
milk_unit <- rep(seq(1, n_units), times = n_day * n_sim) #Repeat the whole sequences times # of times
AT <- vector(mode="logical", n_sim * n_units * n_day) #Make a vector of "FALSE" ATs
day <- rep(rep(seq(start_day, start_day+n_day-1), each = n_units), times = n_sim) #Repeat the days for each simulation run
count <- vector(mode = "logical", n_sim * n_units * n_day)

#matrix with columns:
data <- data.frame(bulk_tank, milk_unit, AT, day, count)
