*This folder contains files for running simulations for different scenarios for Upstate Buffalo.*

# To do:

## Scenarios

1. 3/4 different scenarios for PPC (use point estimate for now, as opposed to distribution w/ mean & sd):  
    - 0 % PPC  
    - Best % PPC from 5 years of VSL data across all samplings  
    - Worst % PPC from 5 years of VSL data across all samplings  
    - Average % PPC from 5 years of VSL data?  
2.	3 scenarios for bactofuge:  
    - With bactofuge – log reduction from Tetra Pak estimate (emailed Forough for this number)  
    - With bactofuge – log reduction from Moraru estimate  
    - Without bactofuge  
3.	2 scenarios for temperature  
    - 45°F   
    - [https://doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-73.2.312]; Laplace distribution with mean = 4.06 and sd = 2.31.  
    
## Data summary to prepare for each scenario above

1.	% samples > 20,000 cfu/mL on d 14, 18, 21, 35
2.	% samples > 1,000,000 cfu/mL on d 14, 18, 21, 35
3.	% samples > 5,000,000 cfu/mL on d 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 35
4.	Day in shelf life that more that 5% above > 1,000,000 cfu/mL
5.	Day in shelf life that more that 1% above > 1,000,000 cfu/mL
6.	% samples more that 4000 cfu/mL on d 14
