This folder contains files for running simultions for different scenarios for Upstate Buffalo.

## To do:
# Scenarios
1. 3/4 different scenarios for PPC (use point estimate for now, as opposed to distribution w/ mean & sd):
    i.	0 % PPC
    ii.	Best % PPC from 5 years of VSL data across all samplings
    iii.	Worst % PPC from 5 years of VSL data across all samplings
    iv.	Average % PPC from 5 years of VSL data?
2.	3 scenarios for bactofuge:
    i.	With bactofuge – log reduction from Tetra Pak estimate (emailed Forough for this number)
    ii.	With bactofuge – log reduction from Moraru estimate
    iii.	Without bactofuge
3.	2 scenarios for temperature
    i.	45°F 
    ii.	https://doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-73.2.312; Laplace distribution with mean = 4.06 and sd = 2.31.
    
#	Data summary to prepare for each scenario above
1.	% samples > 20,000 cfu/mL on d 14, 18, 21, 35
2.	% samples > 1,000,000 cfu/mL on d 14, 18, 21, 35
3.	% samples > 5,000,000 cfu/mL on d 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 35
4.	Day in shelf life that more that 5% above > 1,000,000 cfu/mL
5.	Day in shelf life that more that 1% above > 1,000,000 cfu/mL
6.	% samples more that 4000 cfu/mL on d 14
